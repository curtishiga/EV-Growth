# EV-Growth

As pressure to slow down global warming increases, there's a growing push to phase out internal combustion engine vehicles that rely on fossil fuels and replace them with more energy efficient, clean air electric vehicles. This opens the door for vehicle manufacturers to design and produce a wide range of hybrid and electric vehicles for the everyday consumer or business. This repository takes a dive into Electric Vehicle sales by country, powertrain, and vehicle type from 2010 to 2024 and visulize any trends in Tableau.
